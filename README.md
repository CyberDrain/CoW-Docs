# Introduction

## What Does It Do?

COW is designed to streamline the management of device warranties for CyberDrain [supported-device-types.md](troubleshooting/supported-device-types.md "mention"). Here's a breakdown of its core functionalities:

#### Warranty Tracking

* **Seamless Warranty Maintenance**: COW collects and updates the warranty statuses for your devices, ensuring you have the latest information at your fingertips.
* **Timely Notifications**: Receive alerts and notifications and a unified dashboard to keep you informed about devices in need of attention.

#### Integration with PSA Tools

* **Effortless Synchronization**: Integrate with popular PSA tools like [autotask-psa](inputs/psa-integrations/autotask-psa/ "mention"), [connectwise-psa](inputs/psa-integrations/connectwise-psa/ "mention"), and [halopsa](inputs/psa-integrations/halopsa/ "mention") allowing for smooth data synchronization and management.
* **Enhanced Flexibility**: Choose the configuration of clients and types that best fits your business needs for optimized operations.

#### CSV Import / Export

* **Manual Data Import**: COW supports [csv-import.md](inputs/csv-import.md "mention"). This is ideal for a more customized approach, for a one-time data reconciliation, or those not using one of the supported [psa-integrations](inputs/psa-integrations/ "mention").
* **Export Updated CSVs:** Download the updated list of data from your [clients-and-devices.md](getting-started/navigation/clients-and-devices.md "mention") page once COW has gone and collected all the warranty details and imported them for you.

## What It Does Not Do

It's right there in the name. COW is _Only Warranties._ While it strives to provide a reliable efficient and affordable warranty management tool, there are some limitations to be aware of:

* **Custom Reporting**: The tool is not designed to create extensive vCIO reports.
* **Support for Non-Listed Vendors**: The tool currently supports only certain [supported-device-types.md](troubleshooting/supported-device-types.md "mention").

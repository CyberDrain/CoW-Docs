This page allows you to configure and modify the setup initially completed through the onboarding wizard, offering you the flexibility to adjust the integrations and preferences as needed.

For context on the details of the Onboarding Wizard, or if you never configured it in the first place, you can review the [onboarding-wizard.md](../onboarding-wizard.md "mention") page for more information.

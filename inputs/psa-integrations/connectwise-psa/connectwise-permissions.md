# Connectwise Permissions

To enable secure warranty sync while following least privilege principles, youâ€™ll need to create a dedicated API member and role.

**API Member Setup Steps**

1. Go to **System > Members > API Members**
2. Create new API member (or reuse existing if scoped)
3. Assign the custom role above (e.g., `Warranty Sync - Limited`)
4. Under **API Keys**, generate the **Public/Private Key Pair**
5. Save the **Company, Site, URL**, and **Keys** in your warranty sync setup
